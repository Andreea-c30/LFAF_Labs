## Theory

   A finite automata is a mechanism that is able to recognize patterns. Also known as finite state machine, consists of states, transition that go from one state to another based on the input symbol.
Finite automata can be classified in 2 types:
Deterministic(DFA) - for one input character, the transition goes to one state only. A transition function is defined on every state for every input symbol. Also in DFA null transition is not allowed, it cannot change state without any input character.
Nondeterministic(NFA) - similar to the DFA, it has some different rules, it is allowed to transmit to any number of states for a particular input. It is allowed to do a null move (empty string), which means it can go forward without reading symbols.


## Objectives:

1.  Understand what an automaton is and what it can be used for.

2.  Continuing the work in the same repository and the same project, the following need to be added: a. Provide a function in your grammar type/class that could classify the grammar based on Chomsky hierarchy.

b. For this you can use the variant from the previous lab.

3. According to your variant number (by universal convention it is register ID), get the finite automaton definition and do the following tasks:

a. Implement conversion of a finite automaton to a regular grammar.

b. Determine whether your FA is deterministic or non-deterministic.

c. Implement some functionality that would convert an NDFA to a DFA.

d. Represent the finite automaton graphically (Optional, and can be considered as a bonus point):

- You can use external libraries, tools or APIs to generate the figures/diagrams.

- Your program needs to gather and send the data about the automaton and the lib/tool/API return the visual representation.
