## Theory

   Formal languages, which we study on this course, represents an
essential concept in computer science. As we can define it to be a set
of symbols which are deduced by a set of rules, named grammar.    In
general, grammar consists of: alphabet, nonterminal(VN) and terminal(VT)
variables, a start symbol (S) and a set of rules (P).    There are 4
types of grammar according to Chomsky Classification: \* Type 0 --
Phrase-structure Grammars \* Type 1 -- Context-Sensitive \* Type 2 --
Context-Free \* Type 3 -- Regular

## Objectives:

1.  Understand what a language is and what it needs to have in order to
    be considered a formal one.

2.  Provide the initial setup for the evolving project that you will
    work on during this semester. I said project because usually at lab
    works, I encourage/impose students to treat all the labs like stages
    of development of a whole project. Basically you need to do the
    following:

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
a.  Create a local && remote repository of a VCS hosting service (let us
    all use Github to avoid unnecessary headaches);
b.  Choose a programming language, and my suggestion would be to choose
    one that supports all the main paradigms;
c.  Create a separate folder where you will be keeping the report. This
    semester I wish I won't see reports alongside source code files,
    fingers crossed;

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
3.  According to your variant number (by universal convention it is
    register ID), get the grammar definition and do the following tasks:

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
a.  Implement a type/class for your grammar;
b.  Add one function that would generate 5 valid strings from the
    language expressed by your given grammar;
c.  Implement some functionality that would convert and object of type
    Grammar to one of type Finite Automaton;
d.  For the Finite Automaton, please add a method that checks if an
    input string can be obtained via the state transition from it;

## Implementation description

   To implement this laboratory work I have used two classes to
represent the main objects: Grammar and FiniteAutomata, in python
language. I used a dictionary data type to define the syntax and wrote
the rules from my variant.

    grammar = Grammar({  
        "S": ["aD"],  
      "D": ["bE"],  
      "E": ["cF","dL"],  
      "F": ["dD"],  
      "L": ["aL", "bL", "c"],  
    })

   Firstly, the class Grammar consists of the methods: \* Method to
generate a word (generate_word()) it recieves the starting symbol of the
grammar rules and generates a string based from the grammar I have
defined. For this method I have used a recursive approach, so the rules
are applied until it finds the terminal symbol. \* The method to convert
grammar to finite automata (grammar_to_fa()) - I extracted the set of
states and the alphabet from the production to execute it. Then I set
the initial and final states, and the transitions are calculated using
the grammar rules.    Secondly, the class FiniteAutomata which is
responsible for defining the fa has the methods: \* transition_to - this
method uses state and symbol so it returns the next state according to
the transitions from the conversion. \* validation - this method
verifies the input word and returns true is the word can be generated by
the FA and False - otherwise.    I also have created an additional class
Main where I create the objects, define the grammar and call the
functions. Also, for the last task we had to check if a input string is
valid or not, therefore here is the example I tried to test:

`input_string_1 = "abcdbdac"   print(f"Word {input_string_1} is valid ->", fa.validation(input_string_1))`

`input_string_2 = "abcdbdacaaaaaaaaa" print(f"Word {input_string_2} is valid ->", fa.validation(input_string_2))`

## Conclusions / Screenshots / Results

Working on this laboratory I have implemented a grammar in order to
generate valid words according to the given rules. For the next part I
have used Finite Automata implementation, so I created a method that
converts, an object of type grammar into Finite Automata. Being a new
topic, I have studied a lot in order to understand the concept behind
the problem, and finally I have accomplished to finish all the tasks
